This study investigates, using feature importance analysis, confusion matrices, classification reports and  other metrics, how well different algorithms predict wine quality based on a number of features.

- fixed_acidity
- volatile_acidity	
- citric_acid	
- residual_sugar
- chlorides
- free_sulfur_dioxide	
- total_sulfur_dioxide
- density
- pH	
- sulphates	
- alcohol
- quality	(Target)

We cconlude that Random Forest Classifier performs best in the given classification task. The results show that density and alcohol strongest predictors, having a major impact on the accuracy of the model. 
for edge classes the model performs poorly, with metrics like accuracy and recall falling to around zero. In contrast, the model shows good performance for majority classes, reaching precision for classes 2, 3, and 4.
